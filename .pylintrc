[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable specific warnings/errors for agent code
# Keep these disabled for legitimate reasons:
# - too-few-public-methods: Data classes and utilities are fine with few methods
# - line-too-long: Already enforced via max-line-length=100
# - no-member: Too many false positives with dynamic attributes and C extensions
# - broad-except: Agent code needs resilience, catching Exception is often necessary
# - duplicate-code: Cross-platform code will have legitimate similar patterns
# - cyclic-import: Intentional design pattern with import-outside-toplevel to handle cycles
# - too-many-*: Complexity warnings for large methods that handle multi-platform logic

SysManage Agent is a lightweight, secure, cross-platform system monitoring
agent that connects to SysManage Server via WebSocket for real-time remote
management.

The agent provides real-time system information, command execution
capabilities, and health monitoring. It establishes a secure WebSocket
connection to the SysManage Server using TLS encryption with optional mTLS
validation.

Key features include:
  * Real-time communication via WebSocket
  * System monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network metrics)
  * Remote command execution with security controls
  * Package management capabilities
  * Automatic heartbeat and status reporting
  * Multi-language support (14 languages)
  * Minimal resource footprint
  * Auto-discovery of SysManage servers on the network

The agent runs as a background service and requires no inbound network ports.
All communication is initiated by the agent to the server, enhancing security.

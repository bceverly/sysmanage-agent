## Overview

SysManage Agent is a headless Python application designed to be installed on remote systems for centralized monitoring and management. It establishes a secure WebSocket connection to the SysManage Server and provides real-time system information, command execution capabilities, and health monitoring.

### Key Features

- 🔄 **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based connection for instant responsiveness
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform Support**: Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD
- 🔐 **Secure by Design**: Encrypted communication with mTLS validation, no inbound ports required
- 📊 **System Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, network metrics collection
- ⚡ **Command Execution**: Remote command execution with security controls
- 🔧 **Package Management**: Remote software installation, updates, and OS version upgrade detection
- 💓 **Health Monitoring**: Automatic heartbeat and status reporting
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support**: Native support for 14 languages
- 🏃‍♂️ **Lightweight**: Minimal resource footprint and dependencies
- 🔍 **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically discover and configure with SysManage servers on the network

### Supported Platforms

- 🐧 **Linux**: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora
- 🪟 **Windows**: 10, 11, Server 2019/2022
- 🍎 **macOS**: Intel and Apple Silicon
- 🔒 **FreeBSD**: Latest stable versions
- 🛡️ **OpenBSD**: Latest stable versions

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.9, 3.11, or 3.12 (Python 3.13 not yet supported)
- **Network**: Outbound HTTPS access to SysManage Server
- **Privileges**: Administrative rights for system management tasks (optional)

**📖 For detailed platform-specific installation instructions, visit [sysmanage.org/docs/agent/installation.html](https://sysmanage.org/docs/agent/installation.html)**

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/bceverly/sysmanage-agent.git
cd sysmanage-agent

# 2. Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Note: On BSD systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD), use: . .venv/bin/activate
# Windows users: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start the agent
gmake start                    # Standard agent
# gmake start-privileged       # Privileged agent (for package management)
```

## Configuration

### Auto-Discovery (Recommended)
SysManage Agent includes automatic server discovery that eliminates the need for manual configuration in most scenarios:

1. **No Configuration Required**: If no configuration file exists, the agent automatically attempts to discover SysManage servers on the network
2. **Network Scanning**: The agent sends UDP broadcast discovery requests and listens for server announcements
3. **Automatic Configuration**: Once a server is discovered, the agent writes a complete configuration file automatically
4. **Fallback**: If auto-discovery fails, manual configuration is still supported

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)
Create configuration file at:
- **Linux/macOS/BSD**: `/etc/sysmanage-agent.yaml`
- **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\SysManage\sysmanage-agent.yaml`

**📖 For complete configuration options, visit [sysmanage.org/docs/agent/configuration.html](https://sysmanage.org/docs/agent/configuration.html)**

## Security

SysManage Agent implements multiple layers of security:

- **Communication Security**: TLS 1.2+ encryption for all server communication
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: Certificate-based authentication after host approval
- **Agent Security**: Minimal privilege execution, input validation, safe command execution
- **Network Security**: No inbound ports required, outbound connections only
- **Certificate Management**: Automatic certificate retrieval and validation

**📖 For complete security documentation, visit [sysmanage.org/docs/security/](https://sysmanage.org/docs/security/)**

## Privileged Execution

The agent requires elevated privileges for certain system management operations, particularly package management. Cross-platform privileged runner scripts are included:

- **Unix-like systems**: `run-privileged.sh` - Works on macOS, Linux, and OpenBSD
- **Windows**: `run-privileged.cmd` and `run-privileged.ps1` - Batch and PowerShell scripts

**📖 For detailed privileged execution setup, visit [sysmanage.org/docs/agent/privileged-execution.html](https://sysmanage.org/docs/agent/privileged-execution.html)**

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
make test

# Direct pytest execution
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run linting
make lint
```

### Code Quality Standards
- **Perfect 10.00/10 PyLint score**: Clean, maintainable code
- **Black formatting**: Consistent code style
- **Comprehensive security scanning**: Bandit, Semgrep, Safety, Snyk, TruffleHog
- **Cross-platform testing**: All major operating systems

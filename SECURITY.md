1. **Email**: Send details to security@sysmanage.org
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce  
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Agent version and operating system
   - Configuration details (sanitized)

3. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
4. **Updates**: You'll receive updates every 7 days until resolution

### ðŸ“‹ For Non-Security Issues

## Security Measures

### Communication Security
- TLS 1.2+ encryption for all server communication
- WebSocket Secure (WSS) for real-time communication
- Certificate validation (configurable for development)
- Message integrity verification

### Agent Security
- Minimal privilege execution (no root required)
- Input validation for all server commands
- Safe command execution with timeout limits
- Secure configuration file handling
- No credential storage on disk

### System Integration
- Platform-appropriate security measures
- Safe subprocess execution
- Resource usage limits
- Process isolation where possible

## Security Best Practices

### Installation
- Run agent with minimal required privileges
- Use dedicated service account where possible
- Enable firewall rules for outbound connections only
- Verify agent binary integrity before installation

### Configuration
- Use HTTPS/WSS in production environments
- Enable certificate validation
- Use strong server authentication
- Configure appropriate retry limits
- Set reasonable timeout values

### Monitoring
- Monitor agent logs for suspicious activity
- Set up log rotation and retention policies
- Monitor network connections
- Track resource usage patterns

### Maintenance
- Apply security updates promptly
- Monitor Dependabot security alerts
- Regular security configuration reviews
- Keep Python runtime updated

## Agent Security Model

### Threat Model
The SysManage Agent is designed to be secure against:
- Network-based attacks (encrypted communication)
- Command injection (input validation)
- Privilege escalation (minimal privileges)
- Configuration tampering (secure file handling)

### Trust Boundaries
- **Server Trust**: Agent trusts configured server certificate
- **Command Trust**: Commands from authenticated server are trusted
- **System Trust**: Agent operates within user privilege boundaries
- **Network Trust**: All communication encrypted and authenticated

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Initial Report**: Security researcher reports issue privately
2. **Acknowledgment**: We confirm receipt and begin investigation  
3. **Investigation**: We assess impact and develop fixes
4. **Fix Development**: Patches are developed and tested
5. **Coordinated Release**: Fix is released with security advisory
6. **Public Disclosure**: Details shared after fix is available

## Security Configuration

### Production Deployment
```yaml
server:
  hostname: "your-server.com"
  port: 6443
  use_https: true  # Always use HTTPS in production
  api_path: ""

client:
  # Reasonable retry limits
  registration_retry_interval: 30
  max_registration_retries: 10

logging:
  level: "INFO"  # Avoid DEBUG in production
  file: "/var/log/sysmanage-agent.log"

websocket:
  auto_reconnect: true
  reconnect_interval: 5
  ping_interval: 30
```

### Development Configuration
- Use localhost/development certificates
- Enable debug logging if needed
- Use shorter retry intervals for testing
- Disable certificate validation only for development
